# 📈 Quota: Master Your Daily Input

**Quota** is a motivational application designed for those who believe that greatness is built through daily consistency. The philosophy is simple: Every day you have a **quota** of effort, learning, and discipline to meet. If you hit your quota, you win the day.

I built this app because I realized that whether I was training for the **Informatics Olympiad** or building my **HOME LABS**, the biggest challenge wasn't the code—it was the consistency. **Quota** is the technical solution to mental discipline.

### ✨ Key Features
* **Daily Goal Tracking:** Set and monitor your essential daily tasks (Coding, Fitness, Networking, Learning).
* **Visual Progress:** See your "Quota" fill up in real-time. As someone who loves **Visuals**, I designed this to give instant psychological feedback.
* **Streak Architecture:** Built-in logic to reward consecutive days of meeting your quota, encouraging long-term habit formation.
* **Minimalist Interface:** A clean, distraction-free UI so you spend more time doing the work and less time managing the app.

### 🛠️ Technical Implementation
This app serves as a playground for my interests in **UX/UI** and **Frontend Architecture**:
* **Logic-Driven UI:** Using JavaScript to calculate progress percentages and trigger motivational states.
* **State Persistence:** Ensuring your data stays with you as you move through your day.
* **Responsive Design:** Optimized for both desktop (for deep work) and mobile (for on-the-go tracking).

### 🧠 Why "Quota"?
In systems engineering, a quota prevents a system from crashing by managing resources. In life, a **Quota** prevents you from stalling by managing your intentions. This app is the bridge between my technical mindset and my personal growth.

### 📈 Future Evolution
* **Networking Integration:** Adding a "Peer Quota" feature where you can sync with a partner to keep each other accountable.
* **Data Visualization:** Turning your monthly performance into a heat map (similar to a GitHub contribution graph).

*"Don't just count the days; make the days count toward your quota."*
